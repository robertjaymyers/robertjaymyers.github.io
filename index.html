        <p>This website features apps I've created. Some were created for practice or showcase purposes. Others were created with an official release and specific usage goals in mind. Apps marked as showcase have a downloadable and usable version, but come with an implied warning that they may be incomplete or primitive in their available features and don't have any plans for being supported if they break, or for being added to in the future.</p>
        <p>Beyond the apps shown here, you can find some other miscellanous apps I've created on <a href="https://github.com/robertjaymyers" target="_blank">Github</a>, as well as source code for apps that are shared here.</p>
