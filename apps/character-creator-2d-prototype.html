        <h1>Character Creator 2D Prototype</h1>
        <p>Prototype 2D Character Creation tool, with functionality for Saving, Loading, and Exporting combinations of character parts.</p>
        <p>Character Creation tools are something I love the creativity of, so I made this tool for fun and practice to see how far I could go in a 2D space and what that might look like.</p>
        <p>It's designed to be more of a starting point than a finished tool. Something that can be expanded on or changed in the future, to extend how many different parts there are and accommodate the modification of them in the UI.</p>

            <p><b>Compatibility</b>: Windows</p>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>Be creative and design your own character by combining parts in the way you desire and then exporting the combination to an image of your character that you can share. You can swap parts for various areas, like Hair, Chest, or Bottom, and change the color of a variety of different parts, such as Skin Color or Hair Color. (Variety of parts is relatively low, due to this being a prototype and my having limited artistic skill. However, with color modification, you can work out greater breadth of combinations.)</p>

              <h3>How to Use</h3>
              <p>Parts are swapped by clicking the arrows in either direction. Colors for various parts are changed by clicking the buttons with unique icons, as displayed on the left side of the screen. Right-click the screen to get access to saving, loading, exporting, and set background color options.</p>
              <p>From the right-click menu, you can choose:</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="list-item">New Character: Resets the character back to the defaults.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Open Character: Opens a saved character.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Save Character: Saves the current combination of parts for loading and modifying or exporting later. It's recommended that you save these in the Saves folder, since they are just plaintext files, so they could get confused with other files if you saved them just anywhere.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Export Character: Allows you to save the current combination of parts as a PNG image that you can share or stare at.</li>
                <li class="list-item">Set Background Color: Changes the color of the background. This color will be used as the background color when exporting.</li>
              </ul>
