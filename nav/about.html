        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I'm a programmer with a degree in video game design from college and a degree in thinking I know how to make existing games better from talking about games on message boards. Apart from talking, I also enjoy making things. For example, making the program Cute Little Notes to help with note-taking and list-making. Or writing two different fiction novels and then deciding they need major rewrites and putting them aside for the sake of other priorities.</p>
        <p>When I'm not finding ways to laugh at the absurdity of life, I enjoy taking some things very seriously, such as the pursuit of truth and knowledge, so long as doing so doesn't result in being curmudgeonly before my time.</p>
        <p>I generally believe in leaving the world better than I found it, so long as doing so doesn't involve breaking into someone's home to make changes. My favorite philosophy is the ideas of nonviolent communication, as thought up by Marshall Rosenberg and continued posthumously by his organization, The Center for Nonviolent Communication.</p>
        <p>I have dipped my toes, or immersed myself, in many different creative areas over the years: Video game design, creative writing, acting, graphic design, humor, and the subtle art of getting approval from peers when posting things anonymously on the internet.</p>
        <p>Critical thinking is like an extra limb to me and comes in handy when attempting to solve complex problems in programming. It also comes in handy when attempting to write about myself, overthinking the entire process, and producing an enormous number of words. So maybe it's not always handy, but it has its uses.</p>
